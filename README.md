## About me ðŸ‘‹

I am AI and computer science expert with skills in natural language processing (NLP) and IT architectures. My current research focus is on the multi-target stance detection as an NLP task. I am passionate about natural languages in general, not only from a technical perspective. 

I started my professional career as a web developer and had done it for many years, but switched to the field of AI later. Now I hold an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya and an MSc in Computer Science from the University of the Bundeswehr in Munich. I proceed doing my PhD at the latter one in a research project SPARTA.
